# docker-comose file for Django project
# The project spawns two containers, (i) the app itself incorporating Django, uWSGI and nginx and (ii) certbot
# which keeps our ssl cert from letsencrypt up to date.

services:
  app:
    image: --your-image-name-goes-here--
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Mount directories from the host which contain SSL cert info
    volumes:
      - /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
      - /var/www/certbot
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
      - "8443:443"
    # The following command commented out as it causes problems with uwsgi creating a UNIX socket file - not sure why at this point.
    # command: "/bin/sh -c 'while :; do sleep 6h & wait $${!}; nginx -s reload; done & nginx -g \"daemon off;\"'"

  certbot:
    image: certbot/certbot
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Same volumes as above
    volumes:
      - /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
      - /var/www/certbot

    #  Wake up every 12 hours and renew cert if necessary.
    entrypoint: "/bin/sh -c 'trap exit TERM; while :; do certbot renew; sleep 12h & wait $${!}; done;'"
